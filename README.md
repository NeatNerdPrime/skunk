A RubyCritic extension to calculate StinkScore for a file or project.

## What is the StinkScore?

The StinkScore is a value that assesses the technical debt of a module. It takes
into account:

- Code Complexity
- Code Smells
- Code Coverage

The main goal of the StinkScore is to serve as a compass in your next
refactoring adventure. It will help you answer these questions:

- What can I do to pay off technical debt?
- What are the most complicated files with the least code coverage?
- What are good candidates for your next test-writing efforts?
- What are good candidates for your next refactoring efforts?

The formula is not perfect and it is certainly controversial, so any feedback is
welcome as a new issue!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'skunk'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install skunk

## Usage

### Help details

There are not that many options but here they are:

```
skunk -h
Usage: skunk [options] [paths]
    -b, --branch BRANCH              Set branch to compare
    -v, --version                    Show gem's version
    -h, --help                       Show this message
```

### Getting a sorted list of stinkiest files

To get the best results, make sure that you have `coverage/.resultset.json` in
your application directory. That way `skunk` knows what's the status of your
test suite + code coverage.

Then simply run:

```
skunk
```

Then get a list of stinky files:

```
$ skunk
running flay smells

running flog smells
.............
running reek smells
.............
running complexity
.............
running attributes
.............
running churn
.............
running simple_cov
.............

StinkScore Total: 612.31
Modules Analysed: 13
StinkScore Average: 0.47100769230769230769230769231e2
Worst StinkScore: 166.44 (lib/skunk/cli/commands/default.rb)
```

The command will run `rubycritic` and it will try to load code coverage data
from your `.resultset.json` file.

Skunk's report will be in the console. Use it wisely. :)

### Comparing one branch vs. another

Simply run:

```
skunk -b <target-branch-name>
```

Then get a StinkScore average comparison:

```
$ skunk -b master
Switched to branch 'master'
running flay smells
..
running flog smells
..............
running reek smells
..............
running complexity
..............
running attributes
..............
running churn
..............
running simple_cov
..............
Switched to branch 'feature/compare'
running flay smells
..
running flog smells
.................
running reek smells
.................
running complexity
.................
running attributes
.................
running churn
.................
running simple_cov
.................
Base branch (master) average stink score: 290.53999999999996
Feature branch (feature/compare) average stink score: 340.3005882352941
Score: 340.3
```

This should give you an idea if you're moving in the right direction or not.

## Known Issues

The StinkScore should be calculated per method. This would provide a more accurate
representation of the average StinkScore in a module.

I think that the StinkScore of a module should be the average of the StinkScores of
all of its methods.

Right now the StinkScore is calculated using the totals for a module:

- Total Code Coverage Percentage per Module
- Total Churn per Module
- Total Cost per Module

For more details, feel free to review and improve this method: [RubyCritic::AnalysedModule#stink_score]

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
